# etch-a-sketch

This project is a browser-based Etch-A-Sketch game built with HTML, CSS,, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Interactive grid that responds to mouse hover.
- Hovered squares change color in sequence.
- Customizable grid size (from 50x50 up to 100x100).
- Dynamic creation and removal of grid elements with each new size selection.

## How to play

1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Click the "Choose your grid size!" button.
3. Enter a number between 50 and 100 for the size of the grid.
4. Hover your mouse over the squares to draw patterns.

## What I learned

- Dynamic DOM manipulation.
- Event handling.
- CSS Grid for dynamic layout of squares.
- Combining JavaScript and CSS transitions for smooth visual effects.
- User input handling with `prompt()` and validation.

## Notes
- The grid is created dynamically in JavaScript; no pre-existing squares are in the HTML.
- The project demonstrates fundamental DOM manipulation and interactive UI logic.
